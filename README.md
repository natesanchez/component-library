# My First React Storybook
My first React Storybook. I reacreted buttons and forms using a design template as a reference; trying to match the look as close as possible. Doing this project really helped me gain a better understanding of React and how to efficiently use React Components, State, etc. I am looking forward to building more complex storyboards in the future.
